# pa-chat-room
Frist project for Advanced Programming subject.

This project was developed using Java as the main language.

The main objective was having a chat room implemented as a server for 
clients to communicate with which other using some parallel concepts 
in a way that every action that occurred in the server was parallel.

The server should log every action on a server.log file and messages had to be filtered using some filter
expressions given in a file. All the server configurations can be set on server.config.
